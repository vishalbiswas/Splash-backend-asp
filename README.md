# Splash
This repository hosts the backend ASP.NET webservices required to run a
private forum server. This backend is meant to be used in conjunction
with two other projects: (Splash Android Frontend)[https://www.github.com/vishalbiswas/splash]
and (Splash backend database)[https://www.github.com/vishalbiswas/splash-backend-database]

This repository should be the last of the three steps to set it up.

## Requirements
* .NET Core 1.1

## Setup
1) Clone this repo. `git clone https://www.github.com/vishalbiswas/splash-backend-asp`
2) Open a Command Prompt or Terminal and run `dotnet restore`
3) Then `dotnet run`

Using the `dotnet` command requires that you have it in your path variable.
